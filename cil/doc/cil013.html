<H2><A NAME="htoc32">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Known Bugs and Limitations</H2>
<UL><LI>In the new versions of <TT>glibc</TT> there is a function
 <TT>__builtin_va_arg</TT> that takes a type as its second argument. CIL
 handles that through a slight trick. As it parses the function it changes a
 call like:
<PRE>
  mytype x = __builtin_va_arg(marker, mytype)
</PRE>into 
<PRE>
 mytype x;
 __builtin_va_arg(marker, sizeof(mytype), &amp;x);
</PRE>
 The latter form is used internally in CIL. However, the CIL pretty printer
 will try to emit the original code. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>The implementation of <TT>bitsSizeOf</TT> does not take into account the
packing pragmas. However it was tested to be accurate on cygwin/gcc-2.95.3,
Linux/gcc-2.95.3 and on Windows/MSVC.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>We do not support tri-graph sequences (ISO 5.2.1.1).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>GCC has a strange feature called ``extern inline''. Such a function can
be defined twice: first with the ``extern inline'' specifier and the second
time without it. If optimizations are turned off then the ``extern inline''
definition is considered a prototype (its body is ignored). If optimizations
are turned on then the extern inline function is inlined at all of its
occurrences from the point of its definition all the way to the point where the
(optional) second definition appears. No body is generated for an extern
inline function. A body is generated for the real definition and that one is
used in the rest of the file. <BR>
<BR>
CIL will rename your extern inline function (and its uses) with the suffix
 <TT>__extinline</TT>. This means that if you have two such definition, that do
 different things and the optimizations are not on, then the CIL version might
 compute a different answer !<BR>
<BR>
Also, if you have multiple extern inline declarations then CIL will ignore
but the first one. This is not so bad because GCC itself would not like it. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>There are still a number of bugs in handling some obscure features of
GCC. For example, when you use variable-length arrays, CIL turns them into
calls to <TT>alloca</TT>. This means that they are deallocated when the function
returns and not when the local scope ends. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>CIL cannot parse a line containing an empty <TT>#pragma</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>CIL cannot parse the following code (fixing this problem would require
extensive hacking of the LALR grammar):
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue>
int bar(int ()); // This prototype cannot be parsed
int bar(int x()); // If you add a name to the function, it works
int bar(int (*)()); // This also works (and it is more appropriate)
</FONT></PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI>CIL also cannot parse certain K&amp;R old-style prototypes with missing
return type:
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue>
g(); // This cannot be parsed
int g(); // This is Ok
</FONT></PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI>CIL does not understand some obscure combinations of type specifiers
(``signed'' and ``unsigned'' applied to typedefs that themselves contain a
sign specification; you could argue that this should not be allowed anyway):
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue>
typedef signed char __s8;
__s8 unsigned uchartest; // This is unsigned char for gcc
</FONT></PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI>The statement <TT>x = 3 + x ++</TT> will perform the increment of <TT>x</TT>
 before the assignment, while <TT>gcc</TT> delays the increment after the
 assignment. It turned out that this behavior is much easier to implement
 than gcc's one, and either way is correct (since the behavior is unspecified
 in this case). Similarly, if you write <TT>x = x ++;</TT> then CIL will perform
 the increment before the assignment, whereas GCC and MSVC will perform it
 after the assignment.
