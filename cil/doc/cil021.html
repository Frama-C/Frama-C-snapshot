<UL><LI>
<B>June 1, 2005</B>: <B>Released version 1.3.3</B>
<LI><B>May 31, 2005</B>: Fixed handling of noreturn attribute for function
 pointers. 
<LI><B>May 30, 2005</B>: Fixed bugs in the handling of constructors in gcc.
<LI><B>May 30, 2005</B>: Fixed bugs in the generation of global variable IDs.
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Reimplemented the translation of function calls so
 that we can intercept some builtins. This is important for the uses of
 __builtin_constant_p in constants. 
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Export the plainCilPrinter, for debugging.
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug with printing of const attribute for
 arrays. 
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in generation of type signatures. Now they
 should not contain expressions anymore, so you can use structural equality.
 This used to lead to Out_of_Memory exceptions.
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in type comparisons using
 TBuiltin_va_list.
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Improved the constant folding in array lengths and
 case expressions. 
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Added the <TT>__builtin_frame_address</TT> to the set
 of gcc builtins.
<LI><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Added the CIL project to SourceForge.
<LI><B>April 23, 2005</B>: The cattr field was not visited.
<LI><B>March 6, 2005</B>: Debian packaging support
<LI><B>February 16, 2005</B>: Merger fixes.
<LI><B>February 11, 2005</B>: Fixed a bug in <TT>--dopartial</TT>. Thanks to
Nathan Cooprider for this fix. 
<LI><B>January 31, 2005</B>: Make sure the input file is closed even if a
 parsing error is encountered. 
<LI><B>January 11, 2005</B>: <B>Released version 1.3.2</B>
<LI><B>January 11, 2005</B>: Fixed printing of integer constants whose
 integer kind is shorter than an int. 
<LI><B>January 11, 2005</B>: Added checks for negative size arrays and arrays
 too big. 
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Added support for GCC attribute ``volatile'' for
 tunctions (as a synonim for noreturn). 
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Improved the comparison of array sizes when
 comparing array types. 
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed handling of shell metacharacters in the
 cilly command lione.
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed dropping of cast in initialization of
 local variable with the result of a function call.
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed some structural comparisons that were
 broken in the Ocaml 3.08.
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed the <TT>unrollType</TT> function to not forget
 attributes. 
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Better keeping track of locations of function
 prototypes and definitions. 
<LI><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed bug with the expansion of enumeration
 constants in attributes.
<LI><B>October 18, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in cabsvisit.ml. CIl would wrap a
 BLOCK around a single atom unnecessarily. 
<LI><B>August 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.3.1</B>
<LI><B>August 4, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in splitting of structs using 
 <TT>--dosimplify</TT>
<LI><B>July 29, 2004</B>: Minor changes to the type typeSig (type signatures)
 to ensure that they do not contain types, so that you can do structural
 comparison without danger of nontermination. 
<LI><B>July 28, 2004</B>: Ocaml version 3.08 is required. Numerous small 
 changes while porting to Ocaml 3.08. 
<LI><B>July 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.6</B>
<LI><B>July 2, 2004</B>: Character constants such as <TT>'c'</TT> should
 have type <TT>int</TT>, not <TT>char</TT>. Added a utility function
 <TT>Cil.charConstToInt</TT> that sign-extends chars greater than 128, if needed.
<LI><B>July 2, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug that was casting values to int
 before applying the logical negation operator !. This caused
 problems for floats, and for integer types bigger than <TT>int</TT>.
<LI><B>June 13, 2004</B>: Added the field <TT>sallstmts</TT> to a function
 description, to hold all statements in the function.
<LI><B>June 13, 2004</B>: Added new extensions for data flow analyses, and
 for computing dominators.
<LI><B>June 10, 2004</B>: Force initialization of CIL at the start of
Cabs2cil. 
<LI><B>June 9, 2004</B>: Added support for GCC <TT>__attribute_used__</TT>
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.5</B>
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Allow now to run ./configure CC=cl and set the MSVC
compiler to be the default. The MSVC driver will now select the default name
of the .exe file like the CL compiler. 
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the driver. The temporary files are
deleted by the Perl script before the CL compiler gets to them?
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Added the - form of arguments to the MSVC driver.
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Added a few more GCC-specific string escapes, (, [,
{, %, E. 
<LI><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Fixed bug with continuation lines in MSVC.
<LI><B>April 6, 2004</B>: Fixed embarassing bug in the parser: the precedence
 of casts and unary operators was switched. 
<LI><B>April 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug involving statements mixed between
declarations containing initializers. Now we make sure that the initializers
are run in the proper order with respect to the statements.
<LI><B>April 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the merger. The merger was keeping
separate alpha renaming talbes (namespaces) for variables and types. This
means that it might end up with a type and a variable named the same way, if
they come from different files, which breaks an important CIL invariant.
<LI><B>March 11, 2004</B> : Fixed a bug in the Cil.copyFunction function. The
new local variables were not getting fresh IDs. 
<LI><B>March 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the handling of static function
 prototypes in a block scope. They used to be renamed. Now we just consider
 them global. 
<LI><B>February 20, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.4</B>
<LI><B>February 15, 2004</B>: Changed the parser to allow extra semicolons
 after field declarations.
<LI><B>February 14, 2004</B>: Changed the Errormsg functions: error, unimp,
bug to not raise an exception. Instead they just set Errormsg.hadErrors. 
<LI><B>February 13, 2004</B>: Change the parsing of attributes to recognize
 enumeration constants.
<LI><B>February 10, 2004</B>: In some versions of <TT>gcc</TT> the identifier
 _{thread is an identifier and in others it is a keyword. Added code
 during configuration to detect which is the case. 
<LI><B>January 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.3</B>
<LI><B>January 7, 2004</B>: Changed the alpha renamer to be less
conservative. It will remember all versions of a name that were seen and will
only create a new name if we have not seen one. 
<LI><B>December 30, 2003</B> : Extended the <TT>cilly</TT> command to understand
 better linker command options <TT>-lfoo</TT>. 
<LI><B>December 5, 2003</B>: Added markup commands to the pretty-printer
module. Also, changed the ``@&lt;'' left-flush command into ``@''.
<LI><B>December 4, 2003</B>: Wide string literals are now handled
directly by Cil (rather than being exploded into arrays). This is
apparently handy for Microsoft Device Driver APIs that use intrinsic
functions that require literal constant wide-string arguments. 
<LI><B>December 3, 2003</B>: Added support for structured exception handling
 extensions for the Microsoft compilers.
<LI><B>December 1, 2003</B>: Fixed a Makefile bug in the generation of the 
Cil library (e.g., <TT>cil.cma</TT>) that was causing it to be unusable. Thanks
to KEvin Millikin for pointing out this bug. 
<LI><B>November 26, 2003</B>: Added support for linkage specifications
 (extern ``C''). 
<LI><B>November 26, 2003</B>: Added the ocamlutil directory to contain some
utilities shared with other projects. 
<LI><B>November 25, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.2</B>
<LI><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug that allowed a static local to
 conflict with a global with the same name that is declared later in the
 file. 
<LI><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Removed the <TT>--keep</TT> option of the <TT>cilly</TT>
 driver and replaced it with <TT>--save-temps</TT>.
<LI><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Added printing of what CIL features are being
 run.
<LI><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug that resulted in attributes being
 dropped for integer types. 
<LI><B>November 11, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in the visitor for enumeration
 definitions. 
<LI><B>October 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a problem in the configuration script. It
 was not recognizing the Ocaml version number for beta versions. 
<LI><B>October 15, 2003</B>: Fixed a problem in version 1.2.1 that was
 preventing compilation on OCaml 3.04.
<LI><B>September 17, 2003: Released version 1.2.1.</B>
<LI><B>September 7, 2003</B>: Redesigned the interface for choosing
 <TT>#line</TT> directive printing styles. Cil.printLn and
 Cil.printLnComment have been merged into Cil.lineDirectiveStyle.
<LI><B>August 8, 2003</B>: Do not silently pad out functions calls with
arguments to match the prototype. 
<LI><B>August 1, 2003</B>: A variety of fixes suggested by Steve Chamberlain:
initializers for externs, prohibit float literals in enum, initializers for
unsized arrays were not working always, an overflow problem in Ocaml, changed
the processing of attributes before struct specifiers<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>July 14, 2003</B>: Add basic support for GCC's "__thread" storage
qualifier. If given, it will appear as a "thread" attribute at the top of the
type of the declared object. Treatment is very similar to "__declspec(...)"
in MSVC<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed some of the __alignof computations. Fixed
 bug in the designated initializers for arrays (Array.get error).
<LI><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed infinite loop bug (Stack Overflow) in the
 visitor for __alignof.
<LI><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed bug in the conversion to CIL. A function or
 array argument of
 the GCC __typeof() was being converted to pointer type. Instead, it should
 be left alone, just like for sizeof. 
<LI><B>July 7, 2003</B>: New Escape module provides utility functions
 for escaping characters and strings in accordance with C lexical
 rules.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>July 2, 2003</B>: Relax CIL's rules for when two enumeration types are
considered compatible. Previously CIL considered two enums to be compatible if
they were the same enum. Now we follow the C99 standard.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>June 28, 2003</B>: In the Formatparse module, Eric Haugh found and
 fixed a bug in the handling of lvalues of the form ``lv-&gt;field.more''.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>June 28, 2003</B>: Extended the handling of gcc command lines
arguments in the Perl scripts. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>June 23, 2003</B>: In Rmtmps module, simplified the API for
 customizing the root set. Clients may supply a predicate that
 returns true for each root global. Modifying various
 ``<TT>referenced</TT>'' fields directly is no longer supported.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>June 17, 2003</B>: Reimplement internal utility routine
 <TT>Cil.escape_char</TT>. Faster and better. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>June 14, 2003</B>: Implemented support for <TT>__attribute__s</TT>
appearing between "struct" and the struct tag name (also for unions and
enums), since gcc supports this as documented in section 4.30 of the gcc
(2.95.3) manual<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>May 30, 2003</B>: Released the regression tests. 
<LI><B>May 28, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.1.2</B>
<LI><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Add the <TT>simplify</TT> module that compiles CIL
expressions into simpler expressions, similar to those that appear in a
3-address intermediate language.
<LI><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Various fixes and improvements to the pointer
analysis modules. 
<LI><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Added optional consistency checking for
transformations.
<LI><B>May 25, 2003</B>: Added configuration support for big endian machines.
Now <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALlittle_endian">Cil.little_endian</A> can be used to test whether the machine is
little endian or not. 
<LI><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in the handling of inline functions. The
CIL merger used to turn these functions into ``static'', which is incorrect. 
<LI><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Expanded the CIL consistency checker to verify
undesired sharing relationships between data structures. 
<LI><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Fixed bug in the <TT>oneret</TT> CIL module: it was
mishandling certain labeled return statements. 
<LI><B>May 5, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.11</B>
<LI><B>May 5, 2003</B>: OS X (powerpc/darwin) support for CIL. Special 
thanks to Jeff Foster, Andy Begel and Tim Leek. 
<LI><B>April 30, 2003</B>: Better description of how to use CIL for your
analysis. 
<LI><B>April 28, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug with <TT>--dooneRet</TT> and
<TT>--doheapify</TT>. Thanks, Manos Renieris.
<LI><B>April 16, 2003</B>: Reworked management of
 temporary/intermediate output files in Perl driver scripts. Default
 behavior is now to remove all such files. To keep intermediate
 files, use one of the following existing flags:
 <UL><LI>
 <TT>--keepmerged</TT> for the single-file merge of all sources
 <LI><TT>--keep=&lt;<I>dir</I></TT><TT>&gt;</TT> for various other CIL and
 CCured output files
 <LI><TT>-save-temps</TT> for various gcc intermediate files; MSVC
 has no equivalent option
 </UL>
 As part of this change, some intermediate files have changed their
 names slightly so that new suffixes are always preceded by a
 period. For example, CCured output that used to appear in
 ``<TT>foocured.c</TT>'' now appears in ``<TT>foo.cured.c</TT>''.
<LI><B>April 7, 2003</B>: Changed the representation of the <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALGVar">Cil.GVar</A>
global constructor. Now it is possible to update the initializer without
reconstructing the global (which in turn it would require reconstructing the
list of globals that make up a program). We did this because it is often
tempting to use <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFileSameGlobals">Cil.visitCilFileSameGlobals</A> and the <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALGVar">Cil.GVar</A>
was the only global that could not be updated in place. 
<LI><B>April 6, 2003</B>: Reimplemented parts of the cilly.pl script to make
it more robust in the presence of complex compiler arguments. 
<LI><B>March 10, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.9</B>
<LI><B>March 10, 2003</B>: Unified and documented a large number of CIL
Library Modules: oneret, simplemem, makecfg, heapify, stackguard, partial.
Also documented the main client interface for the pointer analysis. 
<LI><B>February 18, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in logwrites that was causing it
to produce invalid C code on writes to bitfields. Thanks, David Park. 
<LI><B>February 15, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.8</B>
<LI><B>February 15, 2003</B>: PDF versions of the manual and API are
available for those who would like to print them out. 
<LI><B>February 14, 2003</B>: CIL now comes bundled with alias analyses. 
<LI><B>February 11, 2003</B>: Added support for adding/removing options from
 <TT>./configure</TT>. 
<LI><B>February 3, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.7</B>
<LI><B>February 1, 2003</B>: Some bug fixes in the handling of variable
argument functions in new versions of <TT>gcc</TT> And <TT>glibc</TT>. 
<LI><B>January 29, 2003</B>: Added the logical AND and OR operators.
Exapanded the translation to CIL to handle more complicated initializers
(including those that contain logical operators).
<LI><B>January 28, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.6</B>
<LI><B>January 28, 2003</B>: Added support for the new handling of
variable-argument functions in new versions of <TT>glibc</TT>. 
<LI><B>January 19, 2003</B>: Added support for declarations in interpreted
 constructors. Relaxed the semantics of the patterns for variables. 
<LI><B>January 17, 2003</B>: Added built-in prototypes for the gcc built-in
 functions. Changed the <TT>pGlobal</TT> method in the printers to print the
 carriage return as well.
<LI><B>January 9, 2003</B>: Reworked lexer and parser's strategy for
 tracking source file names and line numbers to more closely match
 typical native compiler behavior. The visible CIL interface is
 unchanged.
<LI><B>January 9, 2003</B>: Changed the interface to the alpha convertor. Now
you can pass a list where it will record undo information that you can use to
revert the changes that it makes to the scope tables.
<LI><B>January 6, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.5</B>
<LI><B>January 4, 2003</B>: Changed the interface for the Formatcil module.
 Now the placeholders in the pattern have names. Also expanded the
 documentation of the Formatcil module.
 Now the placeholders in the pattern have names.
<LI><B>January 3, 2003</B>: Extended the <TT>rmtmps</TT> module to also remove
 unused labels that are generated in the conversion to CIL. This reduces the
 number of warnings that you get from <TT>cgcc</TT> afterwards.
<LI><B>December 17, 2002</B>: Fixed a few bugs in CIL related to the
 representation of string literals. The standard says that a string literal
 is an array. In CIL, a string literal has type pointer to character. This is
 Ok, except as an argument of sizeof. To support this exception, we have
 added to CIL the expression constructor SizeOfStr. This allowed us to fix
 bugs with computing <TT>sizeof("foo bar")</TT> and <TT>sizeof((char*)"foo bar")</TT>
 (the former is 8 and the latter is 4).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>December 8, 2002</B>: Fixed a few bugs in the lexer and parser
 relating to hex and octal escapes in string literals. Also fixed
 the dependencies between the lexer and parser.
<LI><B>December 5, 2002</B>: Fixed visitor bugs that were causing
 some attributes not to be visited and some queued instructions to be
 dropped.
<LI><B>December 3, 2002</B>: Added a transformation to catch stack
 overflows. Fixed the heapify transformation.
<LI><B>October 14, 2002</B>: CIL is now available under the BSD license
(see the License section or the file LICENSE). <B>Released version 1.0.4</B>
<LI><B>October 9, 2002</B>: More FreeBSD configuration changes, support
for the GCC-ims <TT>__signed</TT> and <TT>__volatile</TT>. Thanks to Axel
Simon for pointing out these problems. <B>Released version 1.0.3</B>
<LI><B>October 8, 2002</B>: FreeBSD configuration and porting fixes.
Thanks to Axel Simon for pointing out these problems. 
<LI><B>September 10, 2002</B>: Fixed bug in conversion to CIL. Now we drop
all ``const'' qualifiers from the types of locals, even from the fields of
local structures or elements of arrays.
<LI><B>September 7, 2002</B>: Extended visitor interface to distinguish visitng
 offsets inside lvalues from offsets inside initializer lists.
<LI><B>September 7, 2002</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.1</B>
<LI><B>September 6, 2002</B>: Extended the patcher with the <TT>ateof</TT> flag.
<LI><B>September 4, 2002</B>: Fixed bug in the elaboration to CIL. In some
cases constant folding of <TT>||</TT> and <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> was computed wrong.
<LI><B>September 3, 2002</B>: Fixed the merger documentation. 
<LI><B>August 29, 2002</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.0.</B>
<LI><B>August 29, 2002</B>: Started numbering versions with a major nubmer,
minor and revisions. Released version 1.0.0.
<LI><B>August 25, 2002</B>: Fixed the implementation of the unique
identifiers for global variables and composites. Now those identifiers are
globally unique.
<LI><B>August 24, 2002</B>: Added to the machine-dependent configuration the
<TT>sizeofvoid</TT>. It is 1 on gcc and 0 on MSVC. Extended the implementation of
<TT>Cil.bitsSizeOf</TT> to handle this (it was previously returning an error when
trying to compute the size of <TT>void</TT>).
<LI><B>August 24, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of structure and
unions to distinguish between undefined structures and those that are defined
to be empty (allowed on gcc). The sizeof operator is undefined for the former
and returns 0 for the latter.
<LI><B>August 22, 2002</B>: Apply a patch from Richard H. Y. to support
FreeBSD installations. Thanks, Richard!
<LI><B>August 12, 2002</B>: Fixed a bug in the translation of wide-character
strings. Now this translation matches that of the underlying compiler. Changed
the implementation of the compiler dependencies.
<LI><B>May 25, 2002</B>: Added interpreted constructors and destructors.
<LI><B>May 17, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of functions to move the
``inline'' information to the varinfo. This way we can print the ``inline''
even in declarations which is what gcc does. 
<LI><B>May 15, 2002</B>: Changed the visitor for initializers to make two
tail-recursive passes (the second is a <TT>List.rev</TT> and only done if one of
the initializers change). This prevents <TT>Stack_Overflow</TT> for large
initializers. Also improved the processing of initializers when converting to
CIL. 
<LI><B>May 15, 2002</B>: Changed the front-end to allow the use of <TT>MSVC</TT>
mode even on machines that do not have MSVC. The machine-dependent parameters
for GCC will be used in that case. 
<LI><B>May 11, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of formals in function
types. Now the function type is purely functional. 
<LI><B>May 4, 2002</B>: Added the function
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFileSameGlobals">Cil.visitCilFileSameGlobals</A> and changed <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFile">Cil.visitCilFile</A> to be
tail recursive. This prevents stack overflow on huge files.
<LI><B>February 28, 2002</B>: Changed the significance of the
<TT>CompoundInit</TT> in <A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEinit">Cil.init</A> to allow for missing initializers at the
end of an array initializer. Added the API function
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALfoldLeftCompoundAll">Cil.foldLeftCompoundAll</A>.
