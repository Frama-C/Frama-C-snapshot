<H2><A NAME="htoc15">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIL Driver</H2><A NAME="sec-driver"></A><BR>
<BR>
We have packaged CIL as an application <TT>cilly</TT> that contains certain
example modules, such as <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> (a module
that instruments code to print the addresses of memory locations being
written). Normally, you write another module like that, add command-line
options and an invocation of your module in <TT>src/main.ml</TT>. Once you compile
CIL you will obtain the file <TT>obj/cilly.asm.exe</TT>. <BR>
<BR>
We wrote a driver for this executable that makes it easy to invoke your
analysis on existing C code with very little manual intervention. This driver
is <TT>bin/cilly</TT> and is quite powerful. Note that the <TT>cilly</TT> script
is configured during installation with the path where CIL resides. This means
that you can move it to any place you want. <BR>
<BR>
A simple use of the driver is:
<PRE>
bin/cilly -D HAPPY_MOOD -I myincludes hello.c -o hello
</PRE>
 This performs the following actions: 
<UL><LI>
preprocessing using the -D and -I arguments with the resulting file left in <TT>hello.i</TT>, 
<LI>the invocation of the <TT>cilly.asm</TT> application which parses <TT>hello.i</TT>
converts it to CIL and the pretty-prints it to <TT>hellocil.c</TT>
<LI>another round of preprocessing with the result placed in <TT>hellocil.i</TT>
<LI>the true compilation with the result in <TT>hellocil.o</TT>
<LI>a linking phase with the result in <TT>hello</TT>
</UL>
Note that <TT>cilly</TT> behaves like the <TT>gcc</TT> compiler with the additional
effect that CIL sees all the source code. This makes it easy
to use it with existing <TT>Makefiles</TT>:
<PRE>
make CC="bin/cilly" LD="bin/cilly"
</PRE>
 <TT>cilly</TT> can also behave as the Microsoft Visual C compiler, if the first
 argument is <TT>--mode=MSVC</TT>:
<PRE>
bin/cilly --mode=MSVC /D HAPPY_MOOD /I myincludes hello.c /Fe hello.exe
</PRE>
 (This in turn will pass a <TT>--MSVC</TT> flag to the underlying <TT>cilly.asm</TT>
 process which will make it understand the Microsoft Visual C extensions)<BR>
<BR>
<TT>cilly</TT> can also behave as the archiver <TT>ar</TT>, if it is passed an
argument <TT>--mode=AR</TT>. Note that only the <TT>cr</TT> mode is supported (create a
new archive and replace all files in there). Note that the previous version of
the archive is lost. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, <TT>cilly</TT> allows you to pass some arguments on to the
underlying <TT>cilly.asm</TT> process. As a general rule all arguments that start
with <TT>--</TT> and that <TT>cilly</TT> itself does not process, are passed on. For
example, 
<PRE>
bin/cilly --dologwrites -D HAPPY_MOOD -I myincludes hello.c -o hello.exe
</PRE>
 will produce a file <TT>hellocil.c</TT> that prints all the memory addresses
written by the application. <BR>
<BR>
The most powerful feature of <TT>cilly</TT> is that it can collect all the
sources in your project, merge them into one file and then apply CIL. This
makes it a breeze to do whole-program analysis and transformation. All you
have to do is to pass the <TT>--merge</TT> flag to <TT>cilly</TT>:
<PRE>
make CC="bin/cilly --dologwrites --merge"
</PRE>
 You can even leave some files untouched:
<PRE>
make CC="bin/cilly --dologwrites --merge --leavealone=foo --leavealone=bar"
</PRE>
 This will merge all the files except those with the basename <TT>foo</TT> and
<TT>bar</TT>. Those files will be compiled as usual and then linked in at the very
end. <BR>
<BR>
The sequence of actions performed by <TT>cilly</TT> depends on whether merging
is turned on or not:
<UL><LI>
If merging is off
 <OL type=1><LI>
 For every file <TT>file.c</TT> to compile
 <OL type=a><LI>
 Preprocess the file with the given arguments to 
 produce <TT>file.i</TT>
 <LI>Invoke <TT>cilly.asm</TT> to produce a <TT>filecil.c</TT>
 <LI>Preprocess to <TT>filecil.i</TT>
 <LI>Invoke the underlying compiler to produce <TT>filecil.o</TT>
 </OL>
 <LI>Link the resulting objects
 </OL>
<LI>If merging is on
 <OL type=1><LI>
 For every file <TT>file.c</TT> to compile
 <OL type=a><LI>
 Preprocess the file with the given arguments to 
 produce <TT>file.i</TT>
 <LI>Save the preprocessed source as <TT>file.o</TT>
 </OL>
 <LI>When linking executable <TT>hello.exe</TT>, look at every object 
 file that must be linked and see if it actually 
 contains preprocessed source. Pass all those files to a 
 special merging application (described in
 Section&nbsp;<A HREF="merger.html#sec-merger">14</A>) to produce <TT>hello.exe_comb.c</TT>
 <LI>Invoke <TT>cilly.asm</TT> to produce a <TT>hello.exe_combcil.c</TT>
 <LI>Preprocess to <TT>hello.exe_combcil.i</TT>
 <LI>Invoke the underlying compiler to produce <TT>hello.exe_combcil.o</TT>
 <LI>Invoke the actual linker to produce <TT>hello.exe</TT>
 </OL>
</UL>
Note that files that you specify with <TT>--leavealone</TT> are not merged and
never presented to CIL. They are compiled as usual and then are linked in at
the end. <BR>
<BR>
And a final feature of <TT>cilly</TT> is that it can substitute copies of the
system's include files:
<PRE>
make CC="bin/cilly --includedir=myinclude"
</PRE>
 This will force the preprocessor to use the file <TT>myinclude/xxx/stdio.h</TT>
(if it exists) whenever it encounters <TT>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>. The <TT>xxx</TT> is
a string that identifies the compiler version you are using. This modified
include files should be produced with the patcher script (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="patcher.html#sec-patcher">15</A>).<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H3><A NAME="htoc16">8.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>cilly</TT> Options</H3>
Among the options for the <TT>cilly</TT> you can put anything that can normally
go in the command line of the compiler that <TT>cilly</TT> is impersonating.
<TT>cilly</TT> will do its best to pass those options along to the appropriate
subprocess. In addition, the following options are supported (a complete and
up-to-date list can always be obtained by running <TT>cilly --help</TT>):
<UL><LI>
<TT>--mode=mode</TT> This must be the first argument if present. It makes
<TT>cilly</TT> behave as a given compiled. The following modes are recognized: 
 <UL><LI>
 GNUCC - the GNU C Compiler. This is the default.
 <LI>MSVC - the Microsoft Visual C compiler. Of course, you should
 pass only MSVC valid options in this case. 
 <LI>AR - the archiver <TT>ar</TT>. Only the mode <TT>cr</TT> is supported and
 the original version of the archive is lost. 
 </UL>
<LI><TT>--help</TT> Prints a list of the options supported.
<LI><TT>--verbose</TT> Prints lots of messages about what is going on.
<LI><TT>--stages</TT> Less than <TT>--verbose</TT> but lets you see what <TT>cilly</TT>
 is doing. 
<LI><TT>--merge</TT> This tells <TT>cilly</TT> to first attempt to collect into one
source file all of the sources that make your application, and then to apply
<TT>cilly.asm</TT> on the resulting source. The sequence of actions in this case is
described above and the merger itself is described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="merger.html#sec-merger">14</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><TT>--leavealone=xxx</TT>. Do not merge and do not present to CIL the files
whose basename is "xxx". These files are compiled as usual and linked in at
the end. 
<LI><TT>--includedir=xxx</TT>. Override the include files with those in the given
directory. The given directory is the same name that was given an an argument
to the patcher (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="patcher.html#sec-patcher">15</A>). In particular this means that
that directory contains subdirectories named based on the current compiler
version. The patcher creates those directories. 
<LI><TT>--usecabs</TT>. Do not CIL, but instead just parse the source and print
its AST out. This should looked like the preprocessed file. This is useful
when you suspect that the conversion to CIL phase changes the meaning of the
program. 
<LI><FONT COLOR=blue>--save-temps=xxx</FONT>. Temporary files are preserved in the xxx directory.
<LI><FONT COLOR=blue>--save-temps</FONT>. Temporay files are preserved in the current directory.
</UL>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H3><A NAME="htoc17">8.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>cilly.asm</TT> Options</H3>
All of the options that start with <TT>--</TT> and are not understood by
<TT>cilly</TT> are passed on to <TT>cilly.asm</TT>. The following options are
supported:
<UL><LI>
<TT>--out &lt;xxx&gt;</TT>. The name of the pretty-printed file.
<LI><TT>--verbose</TT>. Print lots of random stuff. This is passed on from
<TT>cilly</TT>.
<LI><TT>-help</TT>. Print the help. Actually <TT>cilly</TT> will do this if you
 pass it <TT>--help</TT>. 
<LI><TT>--check</TT>. Run a consistency check over the CIL after every operation. 
<LI><TT>--MSVC</TT>. Enable the MSVC extensions and pretty-print for consumption
by MSVC.
<LI><TT>--warnall</TT>. Print all the warnings.
<LI><TT>--log=xxx</TT>. Set <TT>xxx</TT> to be the name of the log file for the CIL
application. By default <TT>stderr</TT> is used.
<LI><TT>--keepunused</TT>. Do not attempt to remove the unused variables and
 types from CIL. 
<LI><TT>--noPrintLn</TT>. Do not print line numbers.
<LI><TT>--commPrintLn</TT>. Print line numbers but in comments.
<LI><TT>--printCilAsIs</TT>. Do not attempt to simplify the program while
 printing. If this is turned on, then all loops will be printed as
 ``while(1)'', as they are in the internal language.
<LI><TT>--extrafiles &lt;xxx&gt;</TT>. Give the name of a text file that contains
whitespace-separated named of additional files to process.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><TT>--dologcalls</TT>. Insert code in the processed source to print the name of
functions as are called. Implemented in <TT>src/ext/logcalls.ml</TT>.
<LI><TT>--dologwrites</TT>. Insert code in the processed source to print the
address of all memory writes. Implemented in <TT>src/ext/logwrites.ml</TT>.
<LI><TT>--dooneRet</TT>. Make each function have at most one 'return'.
Implemented in <TT>src/ext/oneret.ml</TT>. 
<LI><TT>--dostackGuard</TT>. Instrument function calls and returns to
maintain a separate stack for return addresses. Implemeted in
<TT>src/ext/heapify.ml</TT>. 
<LI><TT>--domakeCFG</TT>. Make the program look more like a CFG. Implemented
in <TT>src/cil.ml</TT>. 
<LI><TT>--dopartial</TT>. Do interprocedural partial evaluation and
constant folding. Implemented in <TT>src/ext/partial.ml</TT>. 
<LI><TT>--dosimpleMem</TT>. Simplify all memory expressions. Implemented in
<TT>src/ext/simplemem.ml</TT>. <BR>
<BR>
For an up-to-date list of available options, run <TT>cilly.asm --help</TT>. </UL>
