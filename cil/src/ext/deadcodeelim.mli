(** Dead code elimination.

Note this is legacy Cil code, which is probably incorrect wrt. Frama-C
invariants. In particular, it uses inplace visitors to modify the AST.
Use with caution *)


val elim_dead_code : Cil_types.fundec -> Cil_types.fundec
(** Perform one pass of dead code elimination *)

val elim_dead_code_fp : Cil_types.fundec -> Cil_types.fundec
(** Perform dead code elimination until a fixpoint is reach *)

val dce : full:bool -> Cil_types.file -> unit
(** Perform dead code elimination on the entire file. If [full] is [false],
    only one pass is performed. Otherwise, elimination is performed until
    a fixpoint is reached. *)
