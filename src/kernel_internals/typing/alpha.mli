(** Create a new name based on a given name. The new name is formed from a 
 * prefix (obtained from the given name by stripping a suffix consisting of _ 
 * followed by only digits), followed by a special separator and then by a 
 * positive integer suffix. The first argument is a table mapping name 
 * prefixes to some data that specifies what suffixes have been used and how 
 * to create the new one. This function updates the table with the new 
 * largest suffix generated. The "undolist" argument, when present, will be 
 * used by the function to record information that can be used by 
 * {!Alpha.undoAlphaChanges} to undo those changes. Note that the undo 
 * information will be in reverse order in which the action occurred. Returns 
 * the new name and, if different from the lookupname, the location of the 
 * previous occurrence. This function knows about the location implicitly 
 * from the [(Cil.CurrentLoc.get ())]. *)
