(* This algorithm is similar to the region-based analysis of the
   dragon book ("Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd
   Edition)", by Aho, Lam, Sethi and Ullman). But there are some
   important differences:

   - We never build regions; the nesting of natural loops suffice.

   - We do not compose transfer functions. Instead, we rely on the
   fact that Ocaml has first-class functions, and associate to "loop
   edges" functions describing the behaviour of loops.

   The composition of region of the Dragon Book does not fit well the
   translation to terms, for which composition of transfer function
   would mean creation of closures or a costly substitution; this
   algorithm avoids function composition.

   The algorithm could be extended to handle non-natural loops. Instead
   of using the notion of back edges, we could use that of retreating
   edge, starting from a spanning tree of the graph. It should be
   possible to compile strongly connected components with multiple
   entry point several times, introducing the variable at different
   entry points, or inlining part of the loop to "reuse" another entry
   point when feasible. Computation of nested scc can be obtained
   using "Earnest, Balke and Anderson: Analysis of Graphs by Ordering
   of Nodes". It is maybe also possible to use the wto ordering of
   bourdoncle for this purpose. *)
