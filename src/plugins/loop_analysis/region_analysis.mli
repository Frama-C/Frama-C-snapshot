(* An algorithm for region analysis, similar to the one in the
   dragon book ("Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd
   Edition)", by Aho, Lam, Sethi and Ullman).

   The main difference compared to dataflow analysis is the handling
   of loops: the "mu" construction for handling loops allows to
   perform different computations, especially they can perform actions
   when first entering the loop or after the fixpoint has been
   reached.

   TODO: The algorithm does not handle non-natural loops for now. *)
