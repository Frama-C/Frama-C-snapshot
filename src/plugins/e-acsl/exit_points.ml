(* Mapping of statements to local variables available within that statement's
   scope. The mappings of this structure are used to determine variables which
   need to be removed before goto jumps. Generally, if some goto (with
   scope variables are given by set G') jumps to a labeled statement with
   scope variables given by set L', then the goto exists the scopes of
   variables given via set G' \ L'. Consequently, if those variables are
   tracked, they need to be removed from tracking. *)

(* Statement to statement mapping indicating source/destination of a jump.
   For instance, break statements are mapped to switches or loops they jump
   out from and goto statements are mapped to their labeled statements. Notably,
   such information does not really be computed for gotos (since they already
   capture references to labelled statements they jumps to). Nevertheless it is
   done for consistency, so all required information is stored uniformly. *)
