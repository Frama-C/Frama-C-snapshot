(** E-ACSL tracks a local variable by injecting:
   - a call to [__e_acsl_store_block] at the beginning of its scope, and
   - a call to [__e_acsl_delete_block] at the end of the scope.
   This is not always sufficient to track variables because execution
   may exit a scope early (for instance via a goto or a break statement).
   This module computes program points at which extra `delete_block` statements
   need to be added to handle such early scope exits. *)
