  (** {3 Backward Operations } *)

  (** For an unary forward operation F, the inverse backward operator B tries to
      reduce the argument values of the operation, given its result.

      It must satisfy:
        if [B arg res] = v
        then ∀ a ⊆ arg such that [F a] ⊆ res, a ⊆ v

      i.e. [B arg res] returns a value [v] larger than all subvalues of [arg]
      whose result through F is included in [res].

      If [F arg] ∈ [res] is impossible, then [v] should be bottom.

      Any n-ary operator may be considered as a unary operator on a vector
      of values, the inclusion being lifted pointwise.
