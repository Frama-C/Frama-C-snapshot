        then ∀ a ⊆ arg such that [F a] ⊆ res, a ⊆ v

      i.e. [B arg res] returns a value [v] larger than all subvalues of [arg]
      whose result through F is included in [res].

      If [F arg] ∈ [res] is impossible, then [v] should be bottom.

      Any n-ary operator may be considered as a unary operator on a vector
      of values, the inclusion being lifted pointwise.
