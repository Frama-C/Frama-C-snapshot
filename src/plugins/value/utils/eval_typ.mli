(* [compatible_functions typ kfs] filters the list [kfs] to only keep functions
   compatible with the type [typ]. The returned boolean is true if some
   functions were incompatible. If a list of arguments [args] is provided, also
   removes functions incompatible with them. Used to verify a call through a
   function pointer is ok.
   In theory, we could only check that both types are compatible as defined by
   C99, 6.2.7. However, some industrial codes do not strictly follow the norm,
   and we must be more lenient. Thus, some functions are also kept when Eva can
   ignore more or less safely the incompatibility in the types (which is however
   reported in the returned boolean). *)
