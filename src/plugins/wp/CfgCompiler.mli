(** {2 Control Flow Graphs}

    The semantics of a {i cfg} is a collection of execution traces.  We
    introduce the notion of {i node} which represent a program point.
    In case of loop unrolling of function inlining, a node
    generalize the notion of [stmt] : two distinct nodes may refer to the same
    instruction at different memory states.

    We introduce an interpretation I as a partial mapping from nodes [n:node] to
    memory states [s:M.sigma], denoted I(n). The notation I(n) seen as a predicate
    indicates if `n` is in the partial mapping.

    Given a cfg, a node can be associated to {i assumptions} to filter
    interpretation against the memory state at this point.

    Effects and predicates are defined {i wrt} some fresh memory states, and can
    be duplicated at different nodes, each instance being mapped to different
    memory states.

     state at this node.

      Nodes absent from the map are unreachable. Whenever possible,
     predicate [F.ptrue] is returned for inconditionally accessible
     nodes.
