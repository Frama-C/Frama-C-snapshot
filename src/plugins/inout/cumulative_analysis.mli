(** Implementation of a simple meta-analysis on top of the results of
    the value analysis. This implementation correctly handles
    memoization and apparent recursive calls during the value analysis.

    The underlying analysis is supposed to be cumulative at the level
    of a kernel_function (its results are derived from the results on
    all its statements), and mostly non-contextual (all the informations
    can be gathered using a Cil visitor).
