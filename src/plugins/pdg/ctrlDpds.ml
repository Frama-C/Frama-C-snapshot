(** Postdominators (with infinite path extension) *)
(*============================================================================*)
(** This backward dataflow implements a variant of postdominators that verify
    the property P enunciated in bts 963: a statement postdominates itself
    if and only it is within the main path of a syntactically infinite loop.

    The implementation is as follows:
    - compute postdominators with an additional flag infinite loop/non-infinite
    loop. Every path that may terminate does not have the "infinite loop" flag

    - the implementation verifies property P only for Loop statements. To
    obtain the property, the cfg is locally rewritten. For statements
    --> p --> s:Loop --> h --> ... --> e
              ^                        |
              |                        |
              --------------------------
    the edges p --> s are transformed into p --> h, but _not_ the backward
    edges e --> s. This way, s post-dominates itself if and only if s is
    a syntactically infinite loop, but not if there is an outgoing edge. *)
