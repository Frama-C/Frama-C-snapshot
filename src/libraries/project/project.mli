(** Projects management.

    A project groups together all the internal states of Frama-C. An internal
    state is roughly the result of a computation which depends of an AST. It is
    possible to have many projects at the same time. For registering a new
    state in the Frama-C projects, apply the functor {!State_builder.Register}.
