(* Bourdoncle's WTO algorithm builds on Tarjan's SCC algorithm. In Tarjan:

   - We visit every node once, starting from root, by following the
     successors; this creates a spanning tree of the graph. SCCs are
     subtrees of this spanning tree, whose root is the head of the SCC
     (although in non-natural SCCs, it is possible to enter into a SCC
     without going through the head).

   - This spanning tree is obtained using DFS. What DFS guarantees is
     that there is no path from a child c of a node n to other
     children of n, provided that there is no path from c to an
     ancestor of n. Thus when we visit other children of n, we know
     that they are no path to them from the descendants of c.

   - We assign consecutive numbers to each node in the order in which
     they have been visited. As the iteration is depth-first search,
     this gives a depth-first numbering (DFN).

   - Each time we visit a node n, we push it on a stack. After the
     visit, n is popped, unless a path exists from n to an element
     earlier on the stack. So the stack contains elements currently
     visited or that belongs to a non-trivial scc. Moreover, they 
     are in topological order.
