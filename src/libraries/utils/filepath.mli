(** Functions manipulating filepaths.
    In these functions, references to the current working directory refer
    to the result given by function Sys.getcwd. *)

(** Returns an absolute path leading to the given file.
    The result is similar to [realpath --no-symlinks].
    Some special behaviors include:
    - [normalize ""] (empty string) raises [Invalid_argument]
      (realpath returns an error);
    - [normalize] preserves multiple sequential '/' characters,
      unlike [realpath];
    - non-existing directories in [realpath] may lead to ENOTDIR errors,
      but [normalize] may accept them.

(** [relativize base_name file_name] returns a (strict) relative path name of
    [file_name] w.r.t. [base_name], if [base_name] is a prefix of [file];
    otherwise, returns [file_name] unchanged.
    The default base name is the current working directory name.

(** returns true if the file is strictly relative to [base]
    (that is, it is prefixed by [base_name]), or to the current working directory
    if no base is specified.

(** Pretty-print a path according to these rules:
    - relative filenames are kept, except for leading './', which are stripped;
    - absolute filenames are relativized if their prefix is included in the
      current working directory; also, symbolic names are resolved,
      i.e. the result may be prefixed by known aliases (e.g. FRAMAC_SHARE).
      See {!add_symbolic_dir} for more details.
    Therefore, the result of this function may not designate a valid name
    in the filesystem.
