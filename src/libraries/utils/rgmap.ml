type 'a entry = int * int * 'a

(* Entries are stored in slices of increasing width.
   In a given slice, all entries have the same width, hence a total order is available for each slice.

   Lookup for any entry applying to some range inside a given slice only needs to check for
   subset _vs_ disjoint ranges. This can be implemented by a comparison order over ranges making
   included ranges equal: if two ranges are not included one in the other, they can be ordered.

   Finding entries covering a range in the entire map can then be performed by looking for the first
   applying entry in increasing width.

   The global complexity for lookup is around [log(n)^2], whereas insertion is only [log(n)].
   To evaluate complexity, take for instance the full binary tree of integers in range [0..n],
   with [n=2^N]. Consider one entry for each node of the tree, ranging all the integers it contains.
   There are [N] slices, with slice [i] having [2^(N-i)] entries of width [2^i].
   Lookup in each slice has logarithmic time, ie. [n-i]. Hence, global lookup has complexity [N^2].
