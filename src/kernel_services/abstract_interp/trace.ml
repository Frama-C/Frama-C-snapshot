(* [precedes t1 t2] returns a pair of booleans:

   - the first is true iff an event whose trace is in [t1] may have
   happened before an event whose trace is in [t2]. This is possible
   only if there is a path in both [t1] and [t2] that leads to the
   current block of [t1].

   - the second is true iff an event whose trace is in [t2] may have
   happened before an event whose trace is in [t1].

   Note: because of the overapproximation, we cannot answer
   definitively that t1 indeed happened before t2. We can only answer
   definitively when it could not.

   The presence of common path is computed by first computing the
   intersection of the dags, and then checking if there is a path from
   the root to s1 or s2. If for instance there is no path to s1, it
   means that one of the traces never went to s1 with the same path.
