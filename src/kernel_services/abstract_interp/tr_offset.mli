(** [trim_by_validity ?origin offsets size validity] reduces [offsets] so that
    all accesses to [offsets+(0..size-1)] are valid according to [validity].
    For a size of 0, consider the offsets up to the validity past-one valid.
    The returned boolean indicates that at least one of the offsets does not
    comply with [validity]. If the valid offsets cannot be represented
    precisely, the [Overlap] constructor is returned. When specified,
    the [origin] argument is used as the source of this imprecision . *)
val trim_by_validity :

(** This is a more complete specification of this function, for a single offset
    [o]. We want to write [size>0 bits], on a base possibly valid between
    [min_valid..max_maybe_valid], and guaranteed to be valid between
    [min_valid..max_sure_valid]. The case [max_sure_valid < min_valid] is
    possible: in this case, no bit is guaranteed to be valid. For Valid and
    non-Empty bases, [min_valid<max_maybe_valid] holds. We write
    [start_to==o] and [stop_to==start_to+size-1]. Then

    - If [start_to..stop_to] is not included in [min_valid..max_maybe_valid],
      then the write completely fails: at least one bit is outside the validity.
      This translates to [start_to<min_valid || stop_to > max_maybe_valid]

    - If [start_to..stop_to] is not included in [min_valid..max_sure_valid],
      then we must emit an alarm. This translates to
      [start_to<min_valid || stop_to > max_sure_valid]. This convention works
      even when [min_valid..max_sure_valid] is not a real interval.
