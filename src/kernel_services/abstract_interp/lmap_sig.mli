val copy_offsetmap :

(** [copy_offsetmap alarms loc size m] returns the superposition of the
    ranges of [size] bits starting at [loc] within [m]. [size] must be strictly
    greater than zero. Return [None] if all pointed adresses are invalid in [m].
    The boolean returned indicates that the location may be invalid.

    @raise Error_Top when the location or the state are Top, and there
    is no Top value in the type {!v}. *)

(** @raise Not_found if the varid is not present in the map. *)

val find_base_or_default : Base.t -> t -> offsetmap Bottom.Top.or_top_bottom
(** Same as [find_base], but return the default values for bases
    that are not currently present in the map. Prefer the use of this function
    to [find_base], unless you explicitely want to see if the base is bound. *)


(** {2 Binding variables} *)

(** [add_binding ~reducing ~exact initial_mem loc v] simulates the effect of
    writing [v] at location [loc], in the initial memory state given by
    [initial_mem].
    If [loc] is not writable, {!bottom} is returned.
    If [exact] is true, and [loc] is a precise location, a strong update
    is performed.
    If [reducing] is true, read-only locations are also updated;
    this should only be used to build an initial state,
    or to refine an existing state by a condition.
    Returns [(alarm, offsm)], where [alarm] indicates that it may be invalid
    to write at the location [loc]. [offsm] is the resulting memory after
    the write. *)
val add_binding:
  reducing:bool -> exact:bool -> t -> location -> v -> bool * t

(** [paste_offsetmap ~reducing ~from ~dst_loc ~size ~exact m]
    copies [from], which is supposed to be exactly [size] bits, and pastes
    them at [dst_loc] in [m]. The copy is exact if and only if
    [dst_loc] is exact, and [exact] is true. The returned boolean indicates
    that the destination location may be invalid. Passing [~reducing:true]
    allows writing to location that are read-only. It should only be used
    when creating an initial state, or when reducing an existing value. *)
val paste_offsetmap :

val add_base :  Base.t -> offsetmap -> t -> t

    previous bindings of [b]. No effect on [Top] or [Bottom]. *)

    and binds it to the base. No effect on [Top] or [Bottom]. *)

    the given [Base.t]-indexed tree. *)

(** Removes the base if it is present. Does nothing otherwise. *)

(** {2 Iterators} *)

(** Notice that some iterators require an argument of type {!map}: the
    cases {!Top} and {!Bottom} must be handled separately. All the iterators
    belowonly present bases that are bound to non-default values, according
    to the function [is_default_offsetmap] of the function {!Lmap.Make_Loffset}.

(** {3 Cached iterators} *)

(** These functions are meant to be partially applied to all their arguments
    but the final one (the map). They must be called at the toplevel of OCaml
    modules, as they create persistent caches. *)

    on other maps indexed by type {!Base.Base.t}. *)

    project-aware, and that you must call them at every project switch. *)
