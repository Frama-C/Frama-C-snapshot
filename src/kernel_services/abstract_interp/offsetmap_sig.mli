val create: size:Int.t -> v -> size_v:Int.t -> t
(** [create ~size v ~size_v] creates an offsetmap of size [size] in which the
    intervals [k*size_v .. (k+1)*size_v-1] with [0<= k <= size/size_v] are all

(** {2 Iterators} *)

val iter:
  ((Int.t * Int.t) -> (v * Int.t * Rel.t) -> unit) ->
  t -> unit
(** [iter f m] calls [f] on all the intervals bound in [m], in increasing
    order. The arguments of [f (min, max) (v, size, offset)] are as follows:
    - [(start, stop)] are the bounds of the interval, inclusive.
    - [v] is the value bound to the interval, and [size] its size;  if [size]
      is less than [stop-start+1], [v] repeats itself until [stop].
    - [offset] is the offset at which [v] starts in the interval;
      it ranges over [0..size-1]. If [offset] is [0], [v] starts
      at the beginning of the interval. Otherwise, it starts at [offset-size].
 *)

val fold:
  ((Int.t * Int.t) -> (v * Int.t * Rel.t) -> 'a -> 'a) ->
  t -> 'a -> 'a
(** Same as [iter], but with an accumulator. *)

val fold_between:

  entire:bool ->
  Int.t * Int.t ->
  ((Int.t * Int.t) -> (v * Int.t * Rel.t) -> 'a -> 'a) ->
  t -> 'a -> 'a
(** [fold_between ~direction:`LTR ~entire (start, stop) m acc] is similar to
    [fold f m acc], except that only the intervals that intersect [start..stop]
    (inclusive) are presented. If [entire] is true, intersecting intervals are
    presented whole (ie. they may be bigger than [start..stop]). If [entire]
    is [false], only the intersection with [ib..ie] is presented.
    [fold_between ~direction:`RTL] reverses the iteration order: interval
    are passed in decreasing order. Default is [`LTR]. *)


(** {2 Interval-unaware iterators} *)

val iter_on_values: (v -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** [iter_on_values f m] iterates on the entire contents of [m], but [f]
    receives only the value bound to each interval. Interval bounds, the
    alignment of the value and its size are not computed. *)

val fold_on_values: (v -> 'a -> 'a) -> t -> 'a -> 'a
(** Same as [iter_on_values] but with an accumulator *)

val map_on_values: (v -> v) -> t -> t
(** [map_on_values f m ] creates the map derived from [m] by applying [f] to
    each interval. For each interval, the size of the new value and its offset
    relative to the beginning of the interval is kept unchanged. *)

type map2_decide =
   ReturnLeft | ReturnRight | ReturnConstant of v | Recurse
(** This type describes different possibilities to accelerate a simultaneous
    iteration on two offsetmaps. {!ReturnLeft} (resp. {!ReturnRight}) means
    'return the left (resp. right) operand unchanged, and stop the recursive
    descent'. [ReturnConstant v] means 'return a constant offsetmap of the good
    size and that contains [v] everywhere'. It is always correct to return
    {!Recurse}, which will force the recursion until the maps have been fully
    decomposed.

    Typical usage include functions that verify [f v v = v], maps [m] such that
    [f m m' = m'], etc. *)

val map2_on_values:
  Hptmap_sig.cache_type -> (t -> t -> map2_decide) -> (v -> v -> v) -> t -> t -> t
(** [map2_on_values cache decide join m1 m2] applies [join] pointwise to
    all the elements of [m1] and [m2] and buils the resulting map. This function
    can only be called if [m1] and [m2] contain isotropic values. [decide]
    is called during the iteration, and can be used to return early; it is
    always correct to return {!Recurse}. Depending on [cache], the results of
    the partially applied function [map2_on_values cache decide join] will be
    cached between different calls. *)

(** {2 Searching values} *)

val find :

  ?conflate_bottom:bool ->
  offsets:Ival.t -> size:Integer.t ->
  t -> bool * v
(** Find the value bound to a set of intervals, expressed as an ival, in the
    given rangemap. The returned boolean (alarm) indicates that at least one
    of the offsets does not comply with [validity]. *)

val find_imprecise: validity:Base.validity-> t -> v
(** [find_imprecise ~validity m] returns an imprecise join of the values bound
    in [m], in the range described by [validity].  *)

val find_imprecise_everywhere: t -> v
(** Returns an imprecise join of all the values bound in the offsetmap. *)

val copy_slice:
  validity:Base.validity ->
  offsets:Ival.t -> size:Integer.t ->
  t -> alarm * [`Map of t | `Bottom]
(** [copy_slice ~validity ~offsets ~size m] copies and merges the slices of
    [m] starting at offsets [offsets] and of  size [size]. Offsets invalid
    according to [validity] are removed. [size] must be strictly greater
    than zero. *)

(** {2 Adding values} *)

val add : ?exact:bool -> (Int.t * Int.t) -> (v * Int.t * Rel.t) -> t -> t
(** [add (min, max) (v, size, offset) m] maps the interval
    [min..max] (inclusive) to the value [v] in [m]. [v] is assumed as having
    size [size]. If [stop-start+1] is greater than [size], [v] repeats itself
    until the entire interval is filled. [offset] is the offset at which [v]
    starts in the interval, interpreted as for {!iter}. Offsetmaps cannot
    contain holes, so [m] must already bind at least the intervals [0..start-1].
*)

val update :
  ?origin:Origin.t ->
  validity:Base.validity ->
  exact:bool ->
  offsets:Ival.t ->
  size:Int.t ->
  v ->
  t -> alarm * t_bottom
(** [update ?origin ~validity ~exact ~offsets ~size v m] writes [v],
    of size [size], each [offsets] in [m]; [m] must be of the size implied by
    [validity]. [~exact=true] results in a strong update, while
    [~exact=false] performs a weak update. If [offsets] contains too many
    offsets, or if [offsers] and [size] are not compatible, [offsets] and/or
    [v] are over-approximated. In this case, [origin] is used as the source of
    the resulting imprecision. Returns [`Bottom] when all offsets are invalid.
    The boolean returned indicates a potential alarm. *)

val update_under :
  validity:Base.validity ->
  exact:bool ->
  offsets:Ival.t ->
  size:Int.t ->
  v ->
  t -> alarm * t_bottom
(** Same as {!update}, except that no over-approximation on the set
    of offsets or on the value written occurs. In case of imprecision,
    [m] is not updated. *)


val update_imprecise_everywhere:
  validity:Base.validity ->
  Origin.t -> v ->
  t -> t_bottom
(** [update_everywhere ~validity o v m] computes the offsetmap resulting
    from imprecisely writing [v] potentially anywhere where [m] is valid
    according to [validity]. If a value becomes too imprecise, [o] is used
    as origin. *)

(** {2 Shape} *)

val cardinal_zero_or_one: t -> bool
(** Returns [true] if and only if all the interval bound in the
    offsetmap are mapped to values with cardinal at most 1. *)

val is_single_interval: t -> bool
(** [is_single_interval o] is true if the offsetmap [o] contains a single
    binding. *)

val single_interval_value: t -> v option
(** [single_interval_value o] returns [Some v] if [o] contains a single
    interval, to which [v] is bound, and [None] otherwise. *)

val is_same_value: t -> v -> bool
(** [is_same_value o v] is true if the offsetmap [o] contains a single
    binding to [v], or is the empty offsetmap. *)
