(** {2 Types} *)
(* ************************************************************************* *)

(** A C type is represented in CIL using the type {!Cil_types.typ}.  Among types
    we differentiate the integral types (with different kinds denoting the sign
    and precision), floating point types, enumeration types, array and pointer
    types, and function types. Every type is associated with a list of
    attributes, which are always kept in sorted order. Use {!Cil.addAttribute}
    and {!Cil.addAttributes} to construct list of attributes. If you want to
    inspect a type, you should use {!Cil.unrollType} or {!Cil.unrollTypeDeep} to
    see through the uses of named types.

    CIL is configured at build-time with the sizes and alignments of the
    underlying compiler (GCC or MSVC). CIL contains functions that can compute
    the size of a type (in bits) {!Cil.bitsSizeOf}, the alignment of a type (in
    bytes) {!Cil.alignOf_int}, and can convert an offset into a start and width
    (both in bits) using the function {!Cil.bitsOffset}. At the moment these
    functions do not take into account the [packed] attributes and pragmas. *)

and typ =
  | TVoid of attributes (** Void type. Also predefined as {!Cil.voidType} *)

  | TInt of ikind * attributes
  (** An integer type. The kind specifies the sign and width. Several useful
      variants are predefined as {!Cil.intType}, {!Cil.uintType},
      {!Cil.longType}, {!Cil.charType}. *)

  | TFloat of fkind * attributes
  (** A floating-point type. The kind specifies the precision. You can also use
      the predefined constant {!Cil.doubleType}. *)

  | TPtr of typ * attributes
  (** Pointer type. Several useful variants are predefined as
      {!Cil.charPtrType}, {!Cil.charConstPtrType} (pointer to a constant
      character), {!Cil.voidPtrType}, {!Cil.intPtrType} *)

  | TArray of typ * exp option * bitsSizeofTypCache * attributes
  (** Array type. It indicates the base type and the array length. *)

  | TFun of typ * (string * typ * attributes) list option * bool * attributes
  (** Function type. Indicates the type of the result, the name, type
      and name attributes of the formal arguments ([None] if no arguments
      were specified, as in a function whose definition or prototype we
      have not seen; [Some \[\]] means void). Use {!Cil.argsToList} to
      obtain a list of arguments. The boolean indicates if it is a
      variable-argument function. If this is the type of a varinfo for
      which we have a function declaration then the information for the
      formals must match that in the function's sformals. Use
      {!Cil.setFormals}, or {!Cil.setFunctionType}, or
      {!Cil.makeFormalVar} for this purpose. *)

  | TNamed of typeinfo * attributes
  (** The use of a named type. All uses of the same type name must share the
      typeinfo. Each such type name must be preceded in the file by a [GType]
      global. This is printed as just the type name. The actual referred type
      is not printed here and is carried only to simplify processing. To see
      through a sequence of named type references, use {!Cil.unrollType}. The
      attributes are in addition to those given when the type name was
      defined. *)

      addition to the attributes that were given at the definition of
      the type and which are stored in the compinfo.  *)

      There are some Frama-C builtins that are used to account for OSX's
      peculiarities:
      - __fc_assign takes two arguments and emulate [a1=a2] syntax
      - __fc_float takes one string argument and indicates a floating point
        constant, that will be printed as such.

(** The {!Cil_types.compinfo} describes the definition of a structure or union

    (using either the [TComp] type constructor or from the definition of the
    fields.

    If all you need is to scan the definition of each composite type once, you
    can do that by scanning all top-level [GCompTag].

    Constructing a {!Cil_types.compinfo} can be tricky since it must contain
    fields that might refer to the host {!Cil_types.compinfo} and furthermore
    the type of the field might need to refer to the {!Cil_types.compinfo} for
    recursive types.  Use the {!Cil.mkCompInfo} function to create a
    {!Cil_types.compinfo}. You can easily fetch the {!Cil_types.fieldinfo} for a
    given field in a structure with {!Cil.getCompField}. *)

    {!Cil_types.fundec}.

    All references to a given global or local variable must refer to the same
    copy of the [varinfo]. Each [varinfo] has a globally unique identifier that
    can be used to index maps and hashtables (the name can also be used for this
    purpose, except for locals from different functions). This identifier is
    constructor using a global counter.

    It is very important that you construct [varinfo] structures using only one
    of the following functions:
    - {!Cil.makeGlobalVar} : to make a global variable
    - {!Cil.makeTempVar} : to make a temporary local variable whose name
    will be generated so that to avoid conflict with other locals.
    - {!Cil.makeLocalVar} : like {!Cil.makeTempVar} but you can specify the
    exact name to be used.
    - {!Cil.copyVarinfo}: make a shallow copy of a varinfo assigning a new name
    and a new unique identifier

    A [varinfo] is also used in a function type to denote the list of
    formals. *)

(* ************************************************************************* *)
(** {2 Expressions} *)
(* ************************************************************************* *)

(** The CIL expression language contains only the side-effect free expressions
    of C. They are represented as the type {!Cil_types.exp}. There are several
    interesting aspects of CIL expressions:

    Integer and floating point constants can carry their textual representation.
    This way the integer 15 can be printed as 0xF if that is how it occurred in
    the source.

    CIL uses arbitrary precision integers 
    to represent the integer constants and also stores the
    width of the integer type. Care must be taken to ensure that the constant is
    representable with the given width. Use the functions {!Cil.kinteger},
    {!Cil.kinteger64} and {!Cil.integer} to construct constant expressions. CIL
    predefines the constants {!Cil.zero}, {!Cil.one} and {!Cil.mone} (for -1).

    Use the functions {!Cil.isConstant} and {!Cil.isInteger} to test if an
    expression is a constant and a constant integer respectively.

    CIL keeps the type of all unary and binary expressions. You can think of
    that type qualifying the operator. Furthermore there are different operators
    for arithmetic and comparisons on arithmetic types and on pointers.

    Another unusual aspect of CIL is that the implicit conversion between an
    expression of array type and one of pointer type is made explicit, using the
    [StartOf] expression constructor (which is not printed). If you apply the
    [AddrOf]constructor to an lvalue of type [T] then you will be getting an
    expression of type [TPtr(T)].

    You can find the type of an expression with {!Cil.typeOf}.

    You can perform constant folding on expressions using the function
    {!Cil.constFold}. *)

(* ************************************************************************* *)
(** {2 Left values} *)
(* ************************************************************************* *)

(** Left values (aka Lvalues) are the sublanguage of expressions that can appear
    at the left of an assignment or as operand to the address-of operator.  In C
    the syntax for lvalues is not always a good indication of the meaning of the
    lvalue. For example the C value {v a[0][1][2] v} might involve 1, 2 or 3
    memory reads when used in an expression context, depending on the declared
    type of the variable [a]. If [a] has type [int \[4\]\[4\]\[4\]] then we have
    one memory read from somewhere inside the area that stores the array [a]. On
    the other hand if [a] has type [int ***] then the expression really means [*
    ( * ( * (a + 0) + 1) + 2)], in which case it is clear that it involves three
    separate memory operations.

    An lvalue denotes the contents of a range of memory addresses. This range is
    denoted as a host object along with an offset within the object. The host
    object can be of two kinds: a local or global variable, or an object whose
    address is in a pointer expression. We distinguish the two cases so that we
    can tell quickly whether we are accessing some component of a variable
    directly or we are accessing a memory location through a pointer.  To make
    it easy to tell what an lvalue means CIL represents lvalues as a host object
    and an offset (see {!Cil_types.lval}). The host object (represented as
    {!Cil_types.lhost}) can be a local or global variable or can be the object
    pointed-to by a pointer expression. The offset (represented as
    {!Cil_types.offset}) is a sequence of field or array index designators.

    Both the typing rules and the meaning of an lvalue is very precisely
    specified in CIL.

    The following are a few useful function for operating on lvalues:
    - {!Cil.mkMem} - makes an lvalue of [Mem] kind. Use this to ensure
    that certain equivalent forms of lvalues are canonized.
    For example, [*&x = x].
    - {!Cil.typeOfLval} - the type of an lvalue
    - {!Cil.typeOffset} - the type of an offset, given the type of the
    host.
    - {!Cil.addOffset} and {!Cil.addOffsetLval} - extend sequences
    of offsets.
    - {!Cil.removeOffset} and {!Cil.removeOffsetLval} - shrink sequences
    of offsets.

    The following equivalences hold {v
    Mem(AddrOf(Mem a, aoff)), off   = Mem a, aoff + off
    Mem(AddrOf(Var v, aoff)), off   = Var v, aoff + off
    AddrOf (Mem a, NoOffset)        = a
    v} *)

and lval = lhost * offset

(** The host part of an {!Cil_types.lval}. *)
and lhost =
  | Var        of varinfo
  (** The host is a variable. *)

  | Mem        of exp
(** The host is an object of type [T] when the expression has pointer
    [TPtr(T)]. *)


(** The offset part of an {!Cil_types.lval}. Each offset can be applied to
    certain kinds of lvalues and its effect is that it advances the starting
    address of the lvalue and changes the denoted type, essentially focussing
    to some smaller lvalue that is contained in the original one.  
    @plugin development guide *)
and offset =
  | NoOffset
  (** No offset. Can be applied to any lvalue and does not change either the
      starting address or the type.  This is used when the lval consists of just
      a host or as a terminator in a list of other kinds of offsets. *)

  | Field      of fieldinfo * offset
  (** A field offset. Can be applied only to an lvalue that denotes a structure
      or a union that contains the mentioned field. This advances the offset to
      the beginning of the mentioned field and changes the type to the type of
      the mentioned field. *)

  | Index    of exp * offset
(** An array index offset. Can be applied only to an lvalue that denotes an
    array. This advances the starting address of the lval to the beginning of
    the mentioned array element and changes the denoted type to be the type of
    the array element *)

    order. This is necessary since the offsets are not printed. For arrays the
    list must contain a prefix of the initializers; the rest are 0-initialized.
    For unions there must be exactly one initializer. If the initializer is not

      together with three list of lval, in this order.
      - lvals that are written during the sequence and whose future
      value depends upon the statement (it is legal to read from them, but
      not to write to them)
      - lvals that are written during the evaluation of the statement itself
      - lval that are read.
      - Function calls in the corresponding statement

      of the statement.  Namely, the
      temporary variables generated by cil are excluded (i.e.  it
      is assumed that the "compilation" is correct). In addition,
      side effects caused by function applications are not taken
      into account in the list. For a single statement, the written lvals
      are supposed to be ordered (or their order of evaluation doesn't
      matter), so that an alarm should be emitted only if the lvals read by
      a statement overlap with the lvals written (or read) by another
      statement of the sequence.

      experimental and may miss some unspecified sequences.

    goes to the handler, propagates the exception, or retries the
