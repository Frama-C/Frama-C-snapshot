(* TODO: The dataflow propagation strategy iterates on strongly
   connected components (scc); and for each scc, it iterates on all
   the statements of the scc in order, before starting a new iteration
   on that scc. To make the dataflow efficient, it is important that
   statements inside the scc are ordered topologically, ignoring back
   edges. This is not what is currently done: as the topological sort
   is global, there is no guarantee on the orders between statements
   inside of a cycle.

   Furthermore, to make the dataflow propogation strategy more
   understandable, the topological sort should be stable with regards
   to program order (i.e. the order between a and b may change only
   when there is a path from a to b, and no path from b to a). For
   cycles, the smallest element of the cycle should be the first
   element in program order, which has a predecessor in one of the
   previous strongly connected components. Ocamlgraph has a
   Make_stable functor, but it does not work when some components are
   not connected. *)
