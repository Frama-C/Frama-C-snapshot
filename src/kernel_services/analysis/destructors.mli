(** retrieve local variables with [__fc_destructor] attribute and add
    the appropriate calls to the corresponding destructor function when we
    exit the scope of the variable.

    Argument of the attribute can take the following forms:
    - [AStr f], where [f] is the name of the function to call.
    - [ACons (f, [AInt n])], where [f] is the name of the function to call and
      n an argument that will be passed to f in addition to the variable.
      Will be used for destructing local C++ arrays.
    - [AAddrOf a] where [a] is of the form above, to indicate that the
      destructor should be given the address of the variable and not the
      variable directly

    susceptible to change the CFG of the program (e.g.
    {!Exn_flow.transform_category})
