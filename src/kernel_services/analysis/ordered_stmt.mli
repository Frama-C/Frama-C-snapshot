(** An [ordered_stmt] is an int representing a stmt in a particular
    function.  They are sorted by the topological ordering of
    stmts (s1 < s2 if s1 precedes s2, or s2 does not precede s1); they
    are contiguous and start from 0.

    Note: due to the presence of unreachable statements in the graph,
    you should not assume that the entry point is statement number 0
    and the return is statement number |nb_stmts - 1|. Use
    [Kernel_function.find_first_stmt] and
    [Kernel_function.find_return] instead.*)

    whose index are ordered stmts. *)
