/* This file gathers some examples where a product of states may have no
   concretization (if the domains have inferred incompatible properties)
   without being bottom (if the inter-reduction between domains are insufficient
   to prove the incompatibility). The bottom could come from a bottom value,
   or from inconsistent statuses emitted for the same alarm.
   In both cases, an evaluation can lead to bottom without any alarm. The
   analysis should not crash on such cases, but they should be reported to the
   user, as they could also reveal a bug in some domains. */
