{2 Overview}

The Occurrence module aims at highlighting the occurrence of any variable in
the Frama-C GUI. Details about the use of this plugin may be found in
{{:http://frama-c.cea.fr/occurrence.html}the user documentation}.

{2 Inside the plug-in}

The code of this plug-in is quite simple. It is splitted into the analysis
itself and the extension to the GUI. 

The code of this plug-in is quite short but uses most advanced Frama-C
features (visitor, projects, journalisation, log, gui). So it is a good
complete not-toy example of a (kernel-integrated) Frama-C plug-in.
