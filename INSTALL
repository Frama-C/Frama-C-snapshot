===============================================================================
			      AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

--------
Mac OS X
--------

Download the auto-installer from
	 http://frama-c.com/download.html

Then just run it!

Note: this auto-installer is **not** provided for each Frama-C version.

----------------------------------------------------
Debian >= Squeeze 6.0 and Ubuntu >= Lucid Lynx 10.04
----------------------------------------------------

If you are using Debian >= Squeeze 6.0 or Ubuntu >= Lucid Lynx 10.04 then
a Frama-C package is provided:

  sudo apt-get install frama-c

or, if you don't want the Gtk-based GUI:
  sudo apt-get install frama-c-base

------------
Fedora >= 13
------------

If you are using Fedora >= 13 then a Frama-C package is provided:

  yum install frama-c

----
Opam
----

Opam (http://opam.ocamlpro.com) is a package manager for OCaml libraries and
applications, that runs under Linux and Mac OS X. There is a package for
Frama-C, so that if you have opam installed, you just have to type

  opam install frama-c

Note however that you may need to install Gtk, GtkSourceView and GnomeCanvas
separately. These are C libraries with OCaml bindings that are used by the
GUI. Opam manages the binding but not the external libraries yet.

----
Wodi
----

Wodi (http://wodi.forge.ocamlcore.org/) is a package manager for OCaml libraries
and applications that specifically target the Windows platform. It features
a GUI, so that you just have to select the Frama-C package from there.

===============================================================================
The remainder of these installation instructions is for building Frama-C from
source.

				  QUICK START
===============================================================================

1) Install OCaml if not already installed.

1b) Optionally, for the GUI, also install Gtk, GtkSourceView, GnomeCanvas and
    Lablgtk2 if not already installed.

2a) On Linux-like distribution:
  ./configure && make && sudo make install

2b) On Windows+Cygwin or Windows+MinGW+msys:
  ./configure --prefix C:/windows/path/with/direct/slash && make && make install

3) The binary frama-c (and frama-c-gui if you have lablgtk2) is now installed.

4) Optionally, test your installation by running:
   frama-c -val tests/misc/CruiseControl*.c
   frama-c-gui -val tests/misc/CruiseControl*.c (if frama-c-gui is available)

See below for more detailed and specific instructions.

===============================================================================
				  REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================

- GNU make version >= 3.81
- Objective Caml >= 3.12.1;
- a C compiler with standard C and POSIX headers and libraries

The Frama-C GUI also requires:
- Gtk (>= 2.4)
- GtkSourceView 2.x
- GnomeCanvas 2.x
- LablGtk >= 2.14.0

If OcamlGraph 1.8.5 [1] is already installed, then it will be used by Frama-C.
Otherwise the distributed local copy (directory ocamlgraph) will be used.

If Zarith [2] is installed, it will be used by Frama-C. Otherwise another 
equivalent less efficient library will be use.

Plug-ins may have their own requirements.
Consult their specific documentations for details.

[1] OcamlGraph: http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr
[2] Zarith: http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/zarith

--------------------------
Ubuntu >= Lucid Lynx 10.04
--------------------------

If you are using Ubuntu >= Lucid Lynx 10.04 then an optimal list of packages is
installed by:

sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-native-compilers graphviz \
     	     liblablgtksourceview2-ocaml-dev liblablgtk2-gnome-ocaml-dev

-------------------
Other Linux systems
-------------------

Some other Linux systems (e.g. Fedora) provide packages for the required tools
and libraries. Please look at your favorite one.

Anyway, on any Linux systems, you may use Godi
(http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html) for installing Frama-C with all the
OCaml requirements (but you must install C libraries and tools before).

===============================================================================
				 CONFIGURATION
===============================================================================

Frama-C is configured by "./configure [options]"

configure is generated by autoconf, so that the standard options for setting
installation directories are available, in particular '--prefix=/path'.

A plug-in can be enabled by --enable-plugin and disabled by --disable-plugin.
By default, all distributed plug-ins are enabled. Those who defaults to 'no'
are not part of the Frama-C distribution (usually because they are too
experimental to be released as is).

See ./configure --help for the current list of plug-ins, and available options.

Under Cygwin or MinGW:
----------------------
Use "./configure --prefix C:/windows/path/with/direct/slash".

===============================================================================
				  COMPILATION
===============================================================================

Type "make".

Some Makefile targets of interest are:
- doc	   generates the API documentation
- top	   generates an OCaml toplevel embedding Frama-C as a library.
- ptests   generates the executable that takes care of running Frama-C's tests
- oracles  set up the tests oracle of Frama-C test suite for your own
           configuration.
- tests    performs Frama-C's own tests (use it after oracles)

===============================================================================
				  INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

Type "make install"
(depending on the installation directory, may require superuser privileges).

It is possible to install in a given directory by setting
the DESTDIR variable: "make install DESTDIR=/tmp" installs Frama-C in
sub-directories of /tmp.

The following files are installed.

Executables: (usually in /usr/local/bin)
------------
- frama-c
- frama-c-gui	    if available
- frama-c.byte      bytecode version of frama-c
- frama-c-gui.byte  bytecode version of frama-c-gui, if available
- ptests.byte       testing tools for Frama-c
- frama-c.toplevel  if 'make top' previously done

Shared files: (usually in /usr/local/share/frama-c and subdirectories)
-------------
- some .h and .c files used as preludes by Frama-C;
- some Makefiles used to compile dynamic plug-ins
- some .rc files used to configure Frama-C
- some image files used by the Frama-C GUI

Manuals: (usually in /usr/local/share/frama-c/manuals)
--------
- the Frama-C manuals as .pdf files

Documentation files: (usually in /usr/local/share/frama-c/doc)
--------------------
- files used to generate dynamic plug-in documentation

Object files: (usually in /usr/local/lib/frama-c)
-------------
- object files used to compile dynamic plug-ins

Plug-in files: (usually in /usr/local/lib/frama-c/plugins)
--------------
- object files of available dynamic plug-ins

Man files: (usually in /usr/local/man/man1)
----------
- man files for frama-c (and frama-c-gui if available)

===============================================================================
			      CUSTOM INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

You can manually move any installed files. However, in such a case, you have to
set specific environment variables in order that Frama-C found the appropriate
objects when required.

The environment variables are:
------------------------------
FRAMAC_SHARE: absolute path to the Frama-C share subdirectory
FRAMAC_LIB: absolute path of the Frama-C lib subdirectory
FRAMAC_PLUGIN: absolute path of the Frama-C plug-in directory.

===============================================================================
			    TESTING THE INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

This step is optional.

Test your installation by running:
  frama-c -val tests/misc/CruiseControl*.c
  frama-c-gui -val tests/misc/CruiseControl*.c (if frama-c-gui is available)

===============================================================================
		      INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL PLUG-INS
===============================================================================

Plug-ins may be released independently of Frama-C.

The standard way for installing them should be:
  ./configure && make && sudo make install

Plug-ins may have their own custom installation procedures.
Consult their specific documentations for details.

===============================================================================
		               API DOCUMENTATION
===============================================================================

For plug-in developers, the API documentation of the Frama-C kernel and
distributed plug-ins is available in the file frama-c-api.tar.gz, after running
"make doc-distrib".

===============================================================================
				 UNINSTALLATION
===============================================================================

Type "make uninstall" to remove Frama-C and all the installed plug-ins
(depending on the installation directory, may require superuser privileges). 
That works only if you have not manually moved the installed files (see Section
"Custom Installation").

===============================================================================
			     HAVE FUN WITH FRAMA-C!
===============================================================================
