####################################
Open Source Release Lithium-20081201
####################################

-! GUI        [2008/12/09] Improved consistency of some information messages.
-  Value      [2008/12/09] Abstract structs are now supported in
	      conjunction with option -lib-entry, and invalid to access.
-! Value      [2008/12/09] Removed outdated warning about uninitialized
	      const variables.
o! Cil        [2008/12/09] Modified typeForInsertedCast hook to take as
	      arguments the expression and its original type in addition
	      to the destination type.
o* Makefile   [2008/12/02] Fixed various bugs in Makefile.template.
-  Logic      [2008/11/24] Added support for (wide) string constants in
	      ACSL formula.
-! Kernel     [2008/11/21] Changed the definition of non-determinist
	      functions in builtin.c. These functions no longer rely on a
	      volatile variable. Analysis logs may change slightly as a result.
-  Value      [2008/11/21] Introduced preliminary support for state
	      reductions on a memory read access. This should eliminate
	      some redundant alarms.
-  Sparecode  [2008/11/20] New option -rm-unused-globals to remove unused
	      global variables and types.
-! Slicing    [2008/11/20] Unused global variables and types are now

	      shared between declaration and use.
o  Cil        [2008/11/17] New methods for visiting compinfo, enuminfo,
	      fieldinfo and enumitem (prevents potential misuse of copy
	      visitor for these types).
-* Jessie     [2008/11/14] Fixed bug with multiple labels in axiomatic
	      definitions.
-  Jessie     [2008/11/14] Added example tests/jessie/minimum_sort.c in

-* Jessie     [2008/11/05] Fixed problem with memory model preventing the
	      proof of some pointer programs. The solution is to require
	      pointers that are compared to belong to the same allocated
	      memory block, which can be expressed in logical annotations
	      using equality of \base_addr constructs.
-  Impact     [2008/11/04] In the GUI, new panel to manage impact analysis
	      actions.
o  Makefile   [2008/11/03] Support for native compilation in Makefile.template
	      (require ocaml >= 3.11).

	      instead of "Misaligned".
-* Value      [2008/10/14] Fixed huge bug in the computation of the
	      dependencies of an expression. Differences are most visible

	      all she slicing options that make use of these.
o! Value      [2008/10/14] Removed argument ~skip_base_deps from all

	      alarm above.
-  Logic      [2008/09/04] Support for \separated.
-  Inout      [2008/09/04] New option -input_with_formals.
-  Journal    [2008/08/28] New options available -load-journal, -journal-name,
	      -journal-disable for user management of journals.
-  Journal    [2008/08/22] Journalization available (only Cmdline and
	      Occurrence are done yet).

	      highlighting when the source function is called, for CAT/AF
	      evaluation.
-  Project    [2008/07/21] Projectification of machdep (bts #?101).
-* Logic      [2008/07/21] Fixed bug "0 can be seen as pointer to any
	      type" (bts #?338).
-* Pdg        [2008/07/21] Fixed bugs for CAT/AF evaluation.
-  GUI        [2008/07/18] Lower the bound on maximum number of displayed
	      globals to 20 (bts #?342).
-  Slicing    [2008/07/18] In the GUI, request related to read/write
	      accesses to lvalues is available from the contextual submenu.
